# Dynamic Fractal Visualizer

A dynamic fractal visualization tool written in C++ using the OpenGL library. This project generates and renders fractals such as the Mandelbrot set with real-time interaction, zooming, panning, and customizable rendering options.

## Features

- Real-time rendering of fractals (e.g., Mandelbrot set, Julia set).
- Interactive zoom and pan functionality.
- High-resolution rendering for intricate fractal details.
- Dynamic parameter adjustments (e.g., colour schemes, iteration limits).
- Smooth animations and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- A modern C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC) with C++17 support.
- OpenGL libraries (version 3.3 or higher recommended).
- A build system such as `CMake` or `Make`.
- GLFW library for window and input management.
- GLAD library for OpenGL function loading.
- Any other dependencies (to be added as the project progresses).
